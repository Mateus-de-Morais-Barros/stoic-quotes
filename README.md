## Why did I make this?
I just wanted an excuse to learn Flask but ended up making an installation script and connecting to an API.

## How to run it:
To create the virtual environment run:

    python installation.py
    
Then activate the venv using the script in:

    venv/Scripts/activate
    
To run the application use the command:

    flask run
